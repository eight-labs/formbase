# Creating Your First Form

You only need one thing to start collecting submissions: a form in the Formbase dashboard. The form name and description show up in emails and exports, so a little clarity here pays off later.

## Step 1: Click "Create Form"

From your dashboard, click the primary action to create a new form.


## Step 2: Give it a clear name and description

Keep names specific to the use case. It helps when you have multiple forms later.

### Example 1: Simple contact form

- **Title:** Contact Form
- **Description:** Messages from the main website contact page

### Example 2: Lead intake for agencies

- **Title:** Acme Agency - Project Intake
- **Description:** New client intake for the marketing site

### Example 3: Product feedback collection

- **Title:** Feedback - Beta Users
- **Description:** Feedback from early-access onboarding flow

## Step 3: Save the form

Once saved, you will land on the form detail page where you can grab the endpoint and manage settings.


## Why this matters

A good title makes your email notifications and exports easy to scan. It also helps teammates find the right form without guesswork.
