# Deleting Submissions

Sometimes you need to remove test entries, duplicates, or sensitive data. Formbase lets you delete submissions from the dashboard.

## Example 1: Delete a single submission

1. Open your form.
2. Click the **...** menu on a row.
3. Choose **Delete**.


## Example 2: Clean up test data

Use the submission table to find your test entries, then remove them one by one.

## Notes

- Deletions are permanent.
- Export data before deletion if you need a backup.
