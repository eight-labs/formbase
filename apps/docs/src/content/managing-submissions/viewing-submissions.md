# Viewing Submissions

Every form has its own submissions table. This is where you can see new entries, download files, and review details.

## Step 1: Open your form

Select your form from the dashboard and open the submissions tab.


## Example 1: Basic review

- New submissions appear at the top.
- Click any row to scan the values quickly.

## Example 2: Sort by date

Use the **Created At** column to sort newest-first or oldest-first.

## Example 3: Review uploaded files

If a submission includes a file or image, the table will show a download link. Images can be previewed directly.

## Tips

- Keep field names short to avoid wide tables.
- Use descriptive field names to make exports clearer later.
