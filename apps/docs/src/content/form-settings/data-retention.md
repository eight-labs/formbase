# Data Retention

Data retention helps you manage privacy and storage costs.

## Example 1: Keep submissions indefinitely

1. Open your form settings.
2. Toggle **Data retention** on.
3. Save changes.


## Example 2: Disable retention for sensitive forms

Turn retention off if you want submissions removed after a fixed retention period.

## Tips

- Match your retention policy to your legal requirements.
- Export data before changing retention settings.
