# Enable or Disable Submissions

Use this when you want to pause submissions temporarily.

## Example 1: Disable a form during maintenance

1. Open your form settings.
2. Toggle **Accept submissions** off.
3. Save changes.


## Example 2: Re-enable after updates

Once your site is ready, re-enable submissions and run a quick test entry.

## Tips

- Disabling submissions does not remove existing data.
- Use this toggle while updating form fields or integrations.
