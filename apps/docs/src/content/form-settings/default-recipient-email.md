# Default Recipient Email

By default, notifications go to the account owner. You can override this per form.

## Example 1: Route a form to support

1. Open your form settings.
2. Enter `support@yourdomain.com` as the default recipient.
3. Save changes.


## Example 2: Send client forms to a client inbox

Use a client-specific email so they get submissions directly.

## Tips

- Use shared inboxes for team visibility.
- Keep recipient emails consistent across related forms.
